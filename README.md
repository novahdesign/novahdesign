### Anova's Github. Welcome!

I'm a Computer Science & Business student, focused on building creative tools to help others. In particular, I'm interested in how best to convey knowledge and using code to create art that resonates.

- 👾 My past experiences include:

Research Intern @ UBC Computer Science, working on human-robot interaction in augmented reality, digital clones, and using tech for social computing. (I was in the multimodal user experience lab, in the HCI & Designing For People Cluster)

Web Design & Web Development Co-op @ SaaS company, using HTML, CSS, JS, Angular, and APIs to develop our customer-facing website. I learned a lot about software companies and web development.

Creative Director & Web Developer @ GadflyAI, creating visual brand and overall aesthetic of AI/ML technical collective, and designing & implementing technical communication.
