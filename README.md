### Anova's Github. Welcome!

I'm a Computer Science & Business student, focused on building creative tools to help others. In particular, I'm interested in creative computing, HCI, AI, ML, open source knowledge, and using tech to create art that resonates with diverse audiences.

- 👾 My past experiences include:

  - Research Intern @ UBC Computer Science, working on human-robot interaction in augmented reality, digital clones, and using tech for social computing. (I was in the multimodal user experience lab, in the HCI & Designing For People Cluster)

  - Web Design & Web Development Co-op @ SaaS company, using HTML, CSS, JS, Angular, and APIs to develop our customer-facing website. I learned a lot about software companies and web development.

  - Creative Director & Web Developer @ GadflyAI, creating visual brand and overall aesthetic of AI/ML technical collective, and designing & implementing using p5js, JS, HTML, CSS, and Cargo. I worked with incredible engineers to communicate very technical projects to a more general audience. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a worldwide zine on creative computing and generative art, with a focus on open source, AI, and cybersecurity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying: a Combined Major in Computer Science and Business at the wonderful University of British Columbia.
- ⚙️ I’m looking to collaborate on: multidisciplinary projects, multimedia art, tech education, EDI, creative use of code, human-computer interaction, and human-ai interaction projects. 
- 🤍 I’m looking for help with: bridging gaps between industry / academia, and tech / art.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I want to build a library.
